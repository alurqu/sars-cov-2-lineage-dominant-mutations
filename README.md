Mutations in half or more of sequences for pango-designated SARS-CoV-2 lineages

These files provide the mutations in half or more of sequences for pango-designated SARS-CoV-2 lineages as computed from the Nextstrain SARS-CoV-2 GenBank metadata.

There files are working intermediates generated by my emerging lineage search code. In essence, these are lists of mutations that my code ignores as uninteresting when they occur in a lineage.

Sequences are assigned to lineages either due to name matches between the Nextstrain SARS-CoV-2 GenBank metadata file and the pango-designation lineages.csv file or due to the lineage called in the Nextstrain SARS-COV-2 GenBank metadata file. There is a possibility that some samples may be assigned to two different lineages due to batching to control job size, but this would only occur if Nextstrain calls a lineage different from the designation in the master lineages.csv file.

There may be also be lineages with no mutations listed. This will occur for small lineages with no representation in the GenBank data.

Note that when a mutation that evolves after lineage designation comes to be present in the majority of sequences for that lineages, it will be added to that lineage's file here.

I can make no warranty on the accuracy of this data. Use at your own risk.
